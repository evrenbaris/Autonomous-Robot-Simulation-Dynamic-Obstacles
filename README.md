# Autonomous Robot Simulation - Dynamic Obstacles

This project simulates an autonomous robot navigating through dynamic obstacles to reach a target using the A* algorithm. The simulation is visualized using Python and Matplotlib.

## Features
- **A* Algorithm:** Calculates the shortest path to the target.
- **Dynamic Obstacles:** Obstacles move randomly, requiring the robot to dynamically replan its path.
- **Visualization:** The robot's movement and path are animated.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
